<p>This is a full-stack web development course for .Net 5.0 that I put together based on the resources available online for a study group I led about one year ago.</p>
<p>This course can be sperated into two overlapping sub-courses: one for frontend and one for backend.</p>
<ul>The full course is divided into 4 sub-sections:</ul>
  <li>C#</li>
  <li>HTML&CSS</li>
  <li>ASP.NET Core</li>
  <li>Blazor</li>
